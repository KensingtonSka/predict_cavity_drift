# Project Outline

An attempt to use machine learning to predict the non-linear (and non-sine) long term frequency drift cause by temperature changes inside the cavity in the lab. This will then be used to update a temperature control box ahead of time so that the cavity is the correct temperature at the correct time.

## Usage

Simply clone the repo and change the paths in `Scripts/predictCavityDrift.py`
